<article>
<p><b class="fff">Group Processes</b><br>After four weeks working together on our Information Technology Report, it is fair to say that we worked well together as a team. We believe the roles assigned in our previous assignment allowed for a successful, efficient team structure. Our assigned roles allowed all members to compliment eachothers work, using our individual personality traits to advantage the team as a whole. These roles will remain the same throughout this assignment. The use of discord was greatly beneficial for the purposes of group communication. Discord will remain our main means of communicating, with Github used for collaboration on our webpage.</p>

<p>Our group will make changes to the document creation and collaboration process. Previously TechPro's made use of Github and Microsoft Word, though Git revision control fails with bineary files. Though we were able to manage this by communicating anytime we were editing document(s), it resulted in major inefficencies. In this assignment TechPro's will make use of GoogleDocs for the creation of documents, allowing for a higher level of real-time collaboration. GoogleDocs has revision control, backups, and a feature allowing for multiple users to work on a single document simutaniously. We believe this will increase efficencies and allow for a greater level of collaboration on the production of reports, documents and presentations.</p>
