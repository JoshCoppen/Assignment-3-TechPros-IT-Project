<section><h1 class="fff"> Team Personality Profile </h1>
<article>
<p><b class="fff">Personality Profile</b><br>As there's a variaty of different people in the world it is important to acknowledge that each person has a different outlook, different personality, and learns in different ways. By using the information provided in various test results we can structure our team in a more beneficial way.</p>
</p>Although people have similar interests, their personalies may still differ. An example of these differences is Jacob and Ryan both being categorised as 'The Campaigner' with the diplomat role, though have differing stratergies. Jacob's a Constant improver while Ryan makes use of People mastery skills. This varies throughout the group but having different personalities is fundamental as it projects more helpful and critical opinions. Considerations can be made to these differences to use them in an advantageous way. For example, Joshua as a protagonist may prove well as a team leader, leading meetings and guiding the team towards goals. Dylan as a logistian will work well in creating unique solutions, thinking in a highly logical and analytical way to further the team towards their goals.</p>
</p>Our groups learning style varies, though the majority learn best or equally-best visually or tactilely. From this test we can determine our team may benefit from visual demonstrations or examples they can try themselves. With consideration to this information, our team may benefit from the use of visual demonstrations or assisting other members in trying new things themselves, rather than explaining purely verbally. Notes could be taken during meetings to allow for other team members to review them in a visual format, further benefitting from the learning style of these members.</p>
</p>In the final test everyone was able to take a test that they found interesting to them. With the outcomes shown there are a variety of differences but overall shows their type of personality. Ryan and Arin both took a similar test which show some resemblance to each other. This could be good as it could show an understanding into one another. Certain tests show how creative or confident some can be. Josh doing a test showing 8 different metrics of creativity and scoring 62.74 could be a good indication that he might know to make a creative looking website. Jacobâ€™s quick aptitude test shows he not only can display verbal and non-verbal ability but also excels numerically which could be beneficial for drafts we send to each other.</p>
</p>All these tests seem let people know why they could be acting a certain way or help understand a certain way they prefer to learn which is helpful to other group members.
