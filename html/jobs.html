<section><h1 class="fff"> Ideal Jobs / Career Plans </h1>
<article>
<p><b class="fff">Ideal Jobs</b><br>Despite all being IT related, the career plans of our team members differ slightly. Dylan, Jacob and Joshua all have a desire to pursue employment in Software Development, while Seth is pursuing Software Engineering. These roles have the similarity of all relating directly to software. Arin and Ryan are looking at different career paths, with Arin pursuing employment as a Security Analyst and Ryan as a Systems Admin / Server Engineer. </p>
<p>Amongst all these career paths, it's seen that employers are typically looking for a bachelor’s in information technology or a related field if a specific education requirement is listed. All but security analyst list requirements of cloud-related knowledge (AWS, Azure, etc). Each role lists strong or excellent communication skills as a requirement, showing communication is a very sought-after baseline skill amongst employers.</p>
<p>Ryan’s chosen career path requires skills relating more to virtualization and LAN/Server environments, opposed to the coding requirements seen in all the software related career paths. Despite this, the requirement of strong communication and team work is still seen.</p>
<p> Though employers still prefer seeing coding experience, Arin's chosen role of Security Analyst typically weighs knowledge of security products and technologies more heavily. Alongside this, knowledge of Linux, Windows and VMware is highly sought-after. This differs from the software roles where coding experience is above all else in requirements.</p>
